# minesweeper_app
This project recreates one of my favorite childhood games, Minesweeper, by utilizing the JavaFX library.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run the EntryPoint.java file, and then the Minesweeper board will appear.
2.Ensure that the game is ran in Java 8, since the implementation involves lambda functions.
